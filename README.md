Welcome to this fantastic project where I've implemented the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python, offering two different coding styles: procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). You have the freedom to explore and compare both approaches, witnessing how the game logic can be elegantly expressed in different ways.

As an added bonus, I've included a convenient package that allows you to easily download and play the game. With this package, you can dive right into the excitement of Tic Tac Toe without any hassle.

But that's not all! In this version, I've introduced a customizable feature that lets players determine the size of the game board. This means you can now enjoy a tailored gaming experience, adjusting the challenge to your liking.

Not only does this package deliver a fun gaming experience, but it also boasts powerful functionalities. From managing the game logic to validating moves and declaring the winner, everything is expertly handled for a seamless play.

To keep you fully engaged, I've designed a user-friendly display of the current board state. This way, you'll always be in the know, strategizing your next move to claim victory!

Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of Tic Tac Toe with this exceptional package, and may the best player win! Enjoy the game to the fullest!
